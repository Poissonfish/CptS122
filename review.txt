- stack : LIFO, last in first output

- queue : FIFO, first in first output

- dynamic data structure (DDS)
  A dynamic data structure (DDS) refers to an organization or collection of data
  in memory that has the flexibility to grow or shrink in size, enabling
  a programmer to control exactly how much memory is utilized.
  Dynamic data structures change in size by having unused memory allocated
  or de-allocated from the heap as needed.

- object-oriented programming (OOP)
  Encapsulation - a way of wrapping of data/attributes and methods/operation
    into a structure.

  Inheritance

  Polymorphism

  Information hiding - Implementation details are hidden within objects
    Guarantees integrity of data.
    Access specifier : public, protected and private

  Overloading - Allows for functions with the same name to be defined.
    The key is the functions must have different parameters (number, type, order)

- object
  an instantiation of a class

- Unified Modeling Language (UML)

- The big three
 should define destructor,
 copy constructor,
 and overloaded copy assignment operator

- Pass-by-value (PBV) - a copy of content of is made

- Pass-by-reference (PBR) - the called function can access the caller's data
  directly and modify the data

- Procedural abstraction
  is the idea that each method should have a coherent conceptual description
  that separates its implementation from its users.
  You can encapsulate behavior in methods that are internal to an object
  or methods that are widely usable.

- Data abstraction
  refers to providing only essential information to the outside world and
  hiding their background details, i.e., to represent the needed information
  in program without presenting the details.

- stream
  a stream is a source or sink of data, usually individual bytes or characters.
  Streams are an abstraction used when reading or writing files, or
  communicating over network sockets.
