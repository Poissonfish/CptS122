	// execute the next statement!
	// Question 7: what function is called in the statement below? What would happen if we did not 
	//             explicitly implement the function? Would the compiler generated one be good enough?
	// List l2 = l1; // shallow or deep copy?
	// Question 8: what would happen if a shallow copy constructor is used, instead of a deep copy constructor, 
	//             when the destructor for each list object is implicily invoked? l2 and l1 would have the same
	//             address stored in the head pointer, and thus, one of the lists would be freed and when the other went
	//             out of scope, the destructor would try to access already freed memory (a dangling pointer situation)!

	// make sure that you finish implementing the overloaded assignment for the List object before you try to 
	// execute the next statement!
	// Question 9: what function is called in the statement below? What would happen if we did not 
	//             explicitly implement the function? Would the compiler generated one be good enough?
	// l3 = l2; // shallow or deep copy? 
	// Question 10: what would happen if a shallow copy assignment is used, instead of a deep copy assignment, 
	//              when the destructor for each list object is implicily invoked? l3 and l2 would have the same

	//              out of scope, the destructor would try to access already freed memory (a dangling pointer situation)!

	// Question 11: how does the List destructor free up the nodes? You will need to visit "List.cpp" to answer this question!
